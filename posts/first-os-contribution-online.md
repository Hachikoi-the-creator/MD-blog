# Your first open source contribution!

### Requieremnts

- Have git installed
- know git basics (add, commit, checkout)
- Github account

**1. Find a repo you want to contribute to**

some examples to get your feet wet:
   - [My own repo to practice](https://github.com/Hachikoi-the-creator/EasyFirstContribution) I can personally comment your code and help you trough the problems it may surge
   - [EddyHubCommunity repo](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice) Github community to help you in your journey
   - [First Contributions repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) Slack community to help you in your journey

**2. Fork the repo**

*gift me a star while you are at it :D*

This makes a copy of the repo to your Github account, you'll update your changes here, for the ask for it to be added to the main repo

**3. Open online VSCode**

Once you have that repo in your Github account press the key `.` in your keyboard

**4. Create a new branch**

This is faster than locally, just need to click the branch icon in VSCode online 
and then create a new branch

**4.1 Missed the branch change promt?**

After you create a new branch, you'll see a promt asking you if you want to move to that branch, you should have clicked yes, but if you clicked outside, you can still move to the branch you just created (as long as you actually select teh one you just created). Just click the branch icon at the bottom

**5. Push changes to your branch**

Here we can feel how easier it is compared to doing it locally, just click the ✔️ after adding a commit message

![Commit & push GUI](https://cdn.glitch.global/10425db4-6abf-43d4-9e55-d3f1d76614b7/commit%20changes.png?v=1651276388061)

**6. Pull request**

Go to your copy of the repo in your Github account, then press this button
